```pascal
PROCEDURE PopAttrs;
```

```python
def vs.PopAttrs():
    return None
```

## Remarks
Calling this procedure more times than PushAttrs has been called during the execution of the script will crash VectorWorks.

## Examples

```pascal
PROCEDURE Example;
BEGIN
PushAttrs;
PenFore(215);
PenBack(5);
PenPat(25);
PenSize(42);

CallTool(-201);
PopAttrs;
END;
RUN(Example);
