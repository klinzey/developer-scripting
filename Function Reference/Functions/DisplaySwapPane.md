# DisplaySwapPane

## Description
Causes the specified swap pane to be displayed within the specified swap control. 

This is called from the dialog's event handling routine.

```pascal
PROCEDURE DisplaySwapPane(
				dialogID      : LONGINT;
				swapControlID : LONGINT;
				groupNumber   : LONGINT);
```

```python
def vs.DisplaySwapPane(dialogID, swapControlID, groupNumber):
    return None
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|dialogID|LONGINT|the ID of the dialog|
|swapControlID|LONGINT|the ID of the swap control|
|groupNumber|LONGINT|1-based index of the swap pane to be displayed|

## Remarks
Note that pane indeces are 1-based in VectorScript, and 0-based in the SDK.  Swap panes are numbered sequentially in the order that they were inserted into the control.

Counter-intuitively, groupNumber is not the index of the groupbox that you want displayed, but rather, a 1-based index which is dynamically incremented every time you call CreateSwapPane. So if you want to display whatever you put into the first call of CreateSwapPane, then call [[VS:DisplaySwapPane]] with an index of 1.
