# Move

## Description
Sets the position of the graphics pen in the VectorWorks document by moving a specified distance from the current pen location.

Horizontal and vertical offsets from the initial location. The final position of the pen at a point whose coordinates are (x+moveDX, y+moveDY).

```pascal
PROCEDURE Move(move : REAL);
```

```python
def vs.Move(move):
    return None
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|move|REAL|X-Y offset distance.|

## Remarks
The difference between this and MoveTo is that this is relative, whereas MoveTo is absolute.

## Examples
==== VectorScript ====
```pascal
Move(6,1);
{ moves the graphics pen 6 units to the right }
{ and 1 unit up from the current position.    }
```
==== Python ====
```python
vs.Move(6, 1)
```
