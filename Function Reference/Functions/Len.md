## Remarks
<b>Vectorworks 2018</b>: This function will behave differently when used during dialog creation. 
:When used between [[VS:CreateLayout]], [[VS:CreateResizableLayout]] and [[VS:RunLayoutDialog]] and [[VS:RunLayoutDialogN]] it will return the length of a string in bytes count, mimicking dialog units.
:This means that the number might not be what you expect during the creation of the layout. In this case where this is a problem, you can use it outside the creation and move the value via a variable.
:This was needed to solve alignment issues with Japanese and Unicode in Vectorworks 2018.
