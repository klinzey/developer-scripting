# Line

## Description
Procedure Line creates a line object in VectorWorks. The line is drawn from the current pen position(x,y) to the specified point. The point may also be thought of as the location (x+dX,y+dY), where dX and dY are x and y offsets, respectively. 

The line object is drawn with the current default attributes unless otherwise specified.

PROCEDURE Line(line : REAL);

```python
def vs.Line(line):
    return None
```
