# Close

## Description
Procedure Close closes the specified text file.


If the filename includes a fully qualified path, the path has to use the appropriate notation for the local operating system:
: <code>Macintosh HD:Applications:VectorWorks:Plug-Ins:Data:Notes.txt</code>
: <code>C:\Program Files\VectorWorks\Plug-Ins\Data\Notes.txt</code>


If the filename includes a path relative to the location of the VectorWorks executable, the subfolder delimiters have to be backslashes:
: <code>Plug-Ins\Data\Notes.txt</code>


If the filename does not include a path, the file is assumed to exist in the same folder as the VectorWorks executable.
