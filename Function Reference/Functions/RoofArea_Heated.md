# RoofArea_Heated

## Description
Returns the heated (interior) area along the slope of roofs or roof faces  that meet the criteria.

```pascal
FUNCTION RoofArea_Heated(c : CRITERIA): REAL;
```

```python
def vs.RoofArea_Heated(c):
    return REAL
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|c|CRITERIA|   |

## Remarks
[[User:CBM-c-|_c_]] (2016.06.28): This returns the area excluding the overhang:
* Roof Faces: the overhang is the part outside the roof axis (line with the arrow). Mind that this doesn't necessarily run parallel to a roof face's edge and the resulting areas are influcenced.
* Roof objects: the overhang is ruled parametrically clicking a face and setting it in the roof dialog. This sets roof axis in the embedded Roof Face[s].
