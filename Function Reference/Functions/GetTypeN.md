# GetTypeN

## Description
Returns the type index of the referenced planar or screen object.

A complete listing of supported object types may be found in the [[VS:Function_Reference_Appendix#Object_Types| Appendix]].

```pascal
FUNCTION GetTypeN(h : HANDLE): INTEGER;
```

```python
def vs.GetTypeN(h):
    return INTEGER
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|h|HANDLE|Handle to object.|

## Remarks
[[User:Rgm|Rgm]] [2012.05.16]: Note that to distinguish a Sheet Layer from a Design Layer, you need to check object variable 154 (ovLayerType), eg. GetObjectVariableInt(layerHd,154). If 1, then it's a Design Layer. If 2, then it's a Sheet Layer. GetTypeN will return 31 (kLayerNode) for both types.
[[User:Ptr|Ptr]] [2020.09.14]: In Python you can also use "h.type" where h=HANDLE to get the object type integer. Other attributes of handles are:
<lineList indent = 1>
<line>aux - Get first aux object, or add to an object to the aux list of this one.</line>
<line>locked - Access locked state of the object.</line>
<line>name - Access the name of the object.</line>
<line>next - Access next object in the drawing list.</line>
<line>parent - Access the parent object in the drawing list.</line>
<line>prev - Access previous object in the drawing list.</line>
<line>selected - Access the selection state of the object.</line>
<line>type - Access the type of the object. Get-only.</line>
</linelist>

## Examples
==== Python ====
```python
_hObject=vs.LSActLayer()#get handle of last selected object

_tObject=vs.GetTypeN(_hObject)# get typeindex
#_tObject=_hObject.type is also possible
