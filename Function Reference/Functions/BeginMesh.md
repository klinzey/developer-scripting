# BeginMesh

## Description
Procedure BeginMesh begins the efinition of a 3D mesh object in VectorWorks. Any 3D point or planar object call after BeginMesh will be included in the mesh object. 

A mesh object allows the user to select and manipulate each vertex within its wire-frame model.

```pascal
PROCEDURE BeginMesh;
```

```python
def vs.BeginMesh():
    return None
```

## Examples
==== VectorScript ====
```pascal
BeginMesh;
ClosePoly;
PenSize(1);
PenPat(2);
FillPat(0);
Poly3D(0',0',4' 0",4' 0",0',4' 0",4' 0",-4' 0",4' 0",0',-4' 0",4' 0");
Smooth(0);
Poly3D(0',0',0',4' 0",0',0',4' 0",-4' 0",0',0',-4' 0",0');
Smooth(0);
Poly3D(0',-4' 0",0',0',-4' 0",4' 0",0',0',4' 0",0',0',0');
Poly3D(4' 0",-4' 0",0',4' 0",-4' 0",4' 0",0',-4' 0",4' 0",0',-4' 0",0');
Poly3D(4' 0",0',0',4' 0",0',4' 0",4' 0",-4' 0",4' 0",4' 0",-4' 0",0');
Poly3D(0',0',0',0',0',4' 0",4' 0",0',4' 0",4' 0",0',0');
EndMesh;
```
