# MoveWallByOffset

## Description
Available in Architect only. Moves the wall perpendicular to its definition line by the specified offset and maintains all wall connections. Wall movement may be constrained by the surrounding geometry so the actual amount of the offset is returned.

```pascal
PROCEDURE MoveWallByOffset(
				theWall    : HANDLE;
				VAR offset : REAL);
```

```python

def vs.MoveWallByOffset(theWall, offset):
    return offset
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|theWall|HANDLE|A handle to the wall to move.|
|offset|REAL|The distance to move the given wall. Negative offsets move the wall to the left and positive offsets move the wall to the right. The actual amount the wall was moved is returned in this field. |

## Returns
The actual amount the wall was moved is passed back in the offset parameter.
