# EndXtrd

## Description
Procedure EndXtrd completes the definition of an extrude object within a VectorWorks document. On calling EndXtrd, the object is created in the document from the preceding object creation calls.

It is recommended to call ResetOrientation3D after 3D object creations in order to ensure that the new 3D objects will draw properly.
