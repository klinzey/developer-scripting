# DTM6_GetZatXY

## Description
Calculates the elevation of the specified 2D point on the specified Site Model object.

```pascal
FUNCTION DTM6_GetZatXY(
				hDTMObject : HANDLE;
				TINType    : INTEGER;
				x          : REAL;
				y          : REAL;
				VAR outZ   : REAL):BOOLEAN;
```

```python
def vs.DTM6_GetZatXY(hDTMObject, TINType, x, y):
    return (BOOLEAN, outZ)
```

## Parameters
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|hDTMObject|HANDLE|A handle to a Site Model object.|
|TINType|INTEGER|A number identifying the Site Model surface (existing or proposed) which elevation is to be calculated.|
|x|REAL|coordinate of the 2D point which elevation is to be calculated.|
|y|REAL|coordinate of the 2D point which elevation is to be calculated.|
|outZ|REAL|Output parameter. The calculated elevation.|

## Remarks
The values of TINType are one of:
*0 - existing - calculates the Z elevation of the point on the existing surface
*1 - proposed - calculates the Z elevation of the point on the proposed surface
*2 - current - depends on the 2D and 3D display parameter of the Site Model. If either of them is proposed then this mode works as '1' otherwise it works as '0'
:The logic is:
::IF (2DDisplay == Proposed) OR (2DDisplay == ExistingOrPoposed) OR (3DDisplay == Proposed) THEN GetZ from [Proposed Surface]
::ELSE GetZ from [Existing Surface]
